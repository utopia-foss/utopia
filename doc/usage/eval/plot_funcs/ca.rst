Cellular Automata Plots
=======================

See :py:mod:`utopya.eval.plots.ca`.

Spatial Representation
----------------------

For a spatial representation of a cellular automaton, there is the ``ca.state``
method. It works with the ``PlotHelper`` interface and supports an animation
update.
For information on how to configure it such that it performs an animation, see
:ref:`plot_animations`.

See :py:func:`utopya.eval.plots.ca.state`.
