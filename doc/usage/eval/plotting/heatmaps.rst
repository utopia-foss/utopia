Heatmaps
========

.. admonition:: Summary \

  On this page, you will see how to

  * use ``.plot.facet_grid`` with ``kind: pcolormesh`` to plot heatmaps and spatially
    two-dimensional plots
  * use ``.plot.ca`` to plot spatially two-dimensional plots
  * adjust the style and coloring of your plots
  * animate your heatmaps based on ``pcolormesh`` by passing a ``frames`` key.
  * animate your heatmaps based on ``.plot.ca``, with more details in the :ref:`section on animations <plot_animations>`.

Plotting heatmaps with ``pcolormesh``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are two options for plotting heatmaps: the standard one should be using ``.plot.facet_grid``
and ``kind: pcolormesh``, and the other -- discussed below -- makes use of ``.plot.ca``:

.. code-block:: yaml

    heatmap:
      based_on:
        - .creator.universe  # or .creator.multiverse for multiverse plots
        - .plot.facet_grid
      kind: pcolormesh

      # further entries here ...

For instance, let us plot the age of each tree in the :ref:`ForestFire <model_ForestFire>`
model at the final time:

.. code-block:: yaml

    heatmap:

      based_on:
        - .creator.universe
        - .plot.facet_grid
        - _default_style

      kind: pcolormesh

      # Select the age of the trees at time = -1
      select:
        data:
          path: age
          transform:
            - .isel: [!dag_prev , {time: -1}]

     x: x

Notice that we need to select a time step in the ``select`` section of the config. This produces a plot like this:

.. image:: ../../../_static/_gen/ForestFire/age_plot/forest_age_with_pcolormesh.pdf
   :width: 800
   :alt: The Forest age from pcolormesh

The ``x`` key is optional, but makes sure that the ``x``-dimension is plotted on the
x-axis (and not the y-axis). As this is a ``facet_grid`` plot, we can specify further axes onto which to plot
data: ``pcolormesh`` supports

* ``x``: the x-axis
* ``y``: the y-axis
* ``row``: the rows of the facet grid
* ``col``: the columns of the facet grid
* ``frames``: animation frames.

For instance, you can drop the ``transform`` argument in the above configuration, thereby
selecting all time steps, and plot the ``time`` variable as the frames of an animation. If you
do this, you must additionally base your plot on an animation base plot, e.g. ``.animation.ffmpeg``:

.. code-block:: yaml

    animated_heatmap:

      # Also include .animation.ffmpeg (or .animation.frames)
      based_on:
        - .creator.universe
        - .plot.facet_grid
        - .animation.ffmpeg  # or .animation.frames

      kind: pcolormesh

      select:
        data: age

      x: x
      frames: time

We will discuss animations in more detail in the :ref:`animations section <plot_animations>`.

Changing the appearance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Use the ``PlotHelper`` (see :ref:`here <plot_helper>`) to set titles, axis labels, scales,
annotations, and much more. With the `dantro ColorManager <https://dantro.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plotting/plot_functions.html#colormanager-integration>`_,
adjusting the colormap is easy. Just add a ``cmap`` key to the plot configuration.
You can define your own continuous or discrete colormap right from the configuration:

.. code-block:: yaml

    my_plot:

      # Everything as before ...

      # Add this to the above configuration:
      cmap:
        continuous: true
        from_values:
          0: crimson
          0.5: gold
          1: dodgerblue

Take a look at the :ref:`style section <colormaps>` for more details. Alternatively,
you can set a `predefined matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/colors/colormaps.html>`_
or `seaborn <https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/color_palettes.html>`_ colormap.

Plotting 2D states with ``.plot.ca``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Equally capable are the ``.plot.ca`` and the (very similar) ``.plot.ca.snapshot`` base plots.
They are optimised for plotting two-dimensional cellular automata, such as the grid-based Utopia
:ref:`SEIRD <model_SEIRD>` and :ref:`ForestFire <model_ForestFire>` models.

To plot a snapshot of a two-dimensional state, base your plot on ``.plot.ca`` and ``.plot.ca.snapshot``.
You can specify the time of the snapshot with the ``frames_isel`` argument (``-1`` by default). Here is
an example for the ForestFire model, using the ``age`` variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

    forest_age_final:

      based_on:
        - .creator.universe
        - .plot.ca
        - .plot.ca.snapshot

      select:
        age: data/ForestFire/age

      frames_isel: -1

      to_plot:
        age:
          title: Forest Age
          cmap: YlGn

This will produce something like this:

.. image:: ../../../_static/_gen/ForestFire/age_plot/forest_age_with_ca.pdf
   :width: 800
   :alt: The Forest age from .plot.ca

.. warning::

    ðŸš§ The ``ColorManager`` is not yet fully implemented for ``.plot.ca``, thus
    you cannot define custom continuous colormaps as for ``pcolormesh``. It is
    therefore recommended to just pass the name of a matplotlib or seaborn
    colormap. Discrete maps work just the same.


Just like ``pcolormesh``, ``.plot.ca`` supports animations. To animate, simply remove the ``.plot.ca.snapshot``
reference in the above code. You do not need to add an animation base plot, since this
is already an integral part of ``.plot.ca``. More details on this are given in the :ref:`animations article <plot_animations>`.
