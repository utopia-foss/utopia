C++ Documentation
=================

Aside from this user manual, there also is a `Utopia C++ documentation <../doxygen/html/index.html>`_ that documents the backend.
Go ahead and click on the link! 😃

By clicking on the above link, you will arrive at the so-called doxygen documentation, which documents the Utopia backend: all code written in C++.


Tips & Tricks
-------------

You might think to yourself: *This looks super complicated -- how can I even read this??*

If unfamiliar with it, doxygen documentations often appear overwhelming.
A few general hints on how to get a grip on it:

* In doxygen, code that belongs together is sorted into `modules <../doxygen/html/modules.html>`_. There, you will get an overview over the different parts of the Utopia backend and what they are used for.
* In the modules, read the **detailed description** before continuing to read with anything else.
* Functions and classes of the same name may have many different template signatures, thus producing multiple entries in the documentation. Don't despair: the first sentence of the function documentation should give a good summary of what this specific specialization does.

As always, the **search functionality** of both the doxygen documentation and your browser (typically: CMD+F or CTRL+F) are a real help here.

.. hint::

  You can use the doxygen documentation to get **a look at the code** itself.
  For that, navigate to the `file list <../doxygen/html/files.html>`_ in the navigation bar.
  This *can* be useful if some function is not documented to a sufficient level to answer the question you have.
