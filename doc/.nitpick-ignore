# List of (reference type, target) pairs that nitpicky-mode should ignore.
#
# Workflow:
#
#   1) In `build`, run `rm -rf doc/html && make doc` to rebuild the docs.
#      (Deleting the whole build/doc directory just leads to doxygen needing
#      to be rebuilt, which takes forever.)
#   2) Inspect the build error log and look for "reference target not found"
#      errors, which are the ones that can be handled here.
#   3) From the errors, extract the reference type (e.g. py:class, py:exc, â€¦)
#      and the target, e.g. numpy.ndarray, SomeException
#   4) Decide whether it should be added here. Reasons for adding it:
#
#       - It's a broken link that can't be fixed, e.g. because the file is
#         rendered elsewhere as well (like README.md)
#
#      Reasons for NOT adding it here:
#
#       - It's a refererence to a package that we don't include the API of
#         but that we can create an intersphinx link for --> add reference
#       - It's a fixable reference error --> go fix it
#
# See the following page for more information and syntax:
#  www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html#confval-nitpick_ignore
#
#
# NOTE Before adding something here, make sure that these really are to be
#      ignored! There is a good chance that these entries could actually be
#      referenced when specified correctly.
#
#      You can use the `sphobjinv` package which comes in very handy for that:
#
#           https://github.com/bskinn/sphobjinv
#
#           sphobjinv suggest <intersphinx-url> <name-to-lookup> -su

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------


# -- Docstring-content --
# The (<type>, optional) part of parameter definitions is seemingly interpreted
# as a type reference, so we need to ignore it.
py:class optional

# -- Python builtin types --
# ... that cannot be referenced (for whatever reason)
py:class collections._Link
py:class weakref
py:class module
py:class ModuleType

# -- third-party packages --
py:class xarray.core.dataarray.DataArray
py:class xarray.core.dataset.Dataset


# -- first-party packages --
# ...


# -- Regex patterns -----------------------------------------------------------
# These are added to the nitpick_ignore_regex list and allow regex patterns in
# both the reference type and the target.
# To add to that list, lines need to start with `re: `, for example:
#
#   re: py:class .*Remove all items from D.*
#
# NOTE That the regex pattern needs to match the whole string, as if ^ and $
#      would be inserted.

# From pydantic and ruamel.yaml (missing from intersphinx)
re: py:class pydantic..*
re: py:class ruamel..*

# From inherited code that uses `:` in places that are mis-interpreted
# ...
