``ForestFire`` Model
====================

The ``ForestFire`` model simulates the development of a forest under influence of fires and was first proposed by P. Bak, K. Chen, and C. Tang in 1990.
Trees grow on a random basis and lightning causes them and the trees in the same cluster to burn down instantaneously; this is the so-called "two state model".

Implementation
--------------

The forest is modelled as a cellular automaton where each cell has can be in one of two states: ``empty`` or ``tree``.

The update procedure is as follows: in each iteration step, iterate over all cells in a random order. For each cell, one of two actions can take place, depending on the current state of the cell:

* An ``empty`` cell becomes a ``tree`` with probability ``p_growth``.
* A ``tree`` ignites with a probability ``p_lightning`` and ignites all cells indirectly connected to it. The cluster burns down instantaneously and all cells transition to state ``empty``.

The new state of a cell is applied directly after it was iterated over, i.e. cell states are updated *sequentially*.

Heterogeneities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
There is the possibility to introduce heterogeneities into the grid, which are implemented as two additional possible cell states: ``source`` and ``stone``:

* A cell can be a constantly ignited fire ``source``, instantly burning down a cluster that comes into contact with it.
* A cell can be a ``stone``, being immune to fire and not taking part in any model dynamics.

These heterogeneities are controlled via the ``ignite_permanantly`` and ``stones`` entries of the model configuration, which both make use of the :ref:`entity selection interface <entity_selection>`.

Data Output
^^^^^^^^^^^
The following data is stored alongside the simulation:

* ``kind``: the state of each cell. Possible values:

  * ``0``: ``empty``
  * ``1``: ``tree``
  * ``2``: (not used)
  * ``3``: ``source``, is constantly ignited
  * ``4``: ``stone``, does not take part in any interaction

* ``age``: the age of each tree, reset after lightning strikes
* ``cluster_id``: a number identifying to which cluster a cell belongs; ``0`` for non-tree cells
* ``tree_density``: the global tree density


Simulation Results
------------------
Below, some example simulation results are shown.
If not marked otherwise, the default values (see below) were used and the grid was chosen to have 1024x1024 cells.

Tree Density
^^^^^^^^^^^^
The time development of the tree density shows how the system relaxes into its quasi-stable equilibrium state.

    Additionally, we can look at the asymptotic tree density.
    Here, "asymptotic" refers to both time and space, as a small grid will show undesirable results.

Cluster Size Analysis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In a complementary cumulative cluster size distribution plot, the scale-free nature of the system can be deduced by observing those parts of the plot that appear linear in a log-log representation.
