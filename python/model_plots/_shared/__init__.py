"""This submodule holds shared operations and plot function definitions.

.. note::

    In order for operations to be registered, make sure to import them here,
    otherwise they will not be pre-loaded and will not be available.
    Strictly speaking, only the operations module needs to be imported; it's
    not important to have the names available here.
