    plot function.

    In this example, nothing spectacular happens: A scatter plot is made and
    a sine curve with some amplitude and frequency is plotted, both of which
    arguments are provided via the DAG.

    Ideally, plot functions should be as generic as possible; just a bridge
    between some data (produced by the DAG) and its visualization.
    This plot is a (completely made-up) example for cases where it makes sense
    to have a rather specific plot...

    .. note::

        To specify the plot in a generic way, omit the ``creator_type``
        argument in the decorator. If you want to specialize the plot function,
        you can of course specify the creator type, but most often that's not
        necessary.

        Check the decorator's signature and the utopya and dantro documentation
        for more information on the DAG framework
