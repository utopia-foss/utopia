# --- Space parameters --------------------------------------------------------
# The physical space this model is embedded in
space:
  periodic: true


# --- CellManager and cell initialization -------------------------------------
cell_manager:
  grid:
    structure: square
    resolution: 128      # in cells per unit length of physical space

  neighborhood:
    mode: Moore

  # Cell initialization parameters
  cell_params:
    # Initial susceptible density, value in [0, 1]
    # Probability that a cell is initialized as susceptible (instead of empty)
    p_susceptible: 0.3

    # Initial immune density, value in [0, 1]
    # With this probability, a cell is initialized as immune, however, only if
    # it was initialized as susceptible already (determined by p_susceptible)
    p_immune: &p_immune 0.001

    # The cell specific probability p_transmit to transmit the disease to other
    # cells. This parameter sets the initial value for each cell.
    # This probability can be manipulated using the transmission_control to either
    # manipulate it for all cell or for a subset of cells at specified times.
    # This allows for example to set some cells to be superspreader.
    p_transmit: &p_transmit
      mode: value
      value:
        default: 1.
      uniform:
        range: [0., 1.]


# --- Model Dynamics ----------------------------------------------------------
# NOTE that the default parameters below are chosen according to the
#      Covid-19 storyline roughly approximating the current knowledge, which
#      of course still changes and updates weekly (updated June 16th, 2020).

# Probability per site and time step to transition from state empty to
# susceptible.
# As default, there are no randomly appearing susceptible cells coming into
# the system.
p_susceptible: 0.

# Probability to be immune per transition from an empty to a susceptible cell
# via p_susceptible.
p_immune: *p_immune

# Cell specific probability to transmit the disease set at transition
# from an empty to a susceptible cell via p_susceptible. This sets the cell
# state `p_transmit` used in the model dynamics.
p_transmit: *p_transmit

# Probability per site and time step for a susceptible cell to _not_ become
# infected if an infected cell is in the neighborhood. This probability
# applies per event so it does _not_ mean that an immune cell is also immune
# in the next iteration step.
p_random_immunity: 0.

# Probability per susceptible cell and time step for a random point exposure
# NOTE This is affected by the exposure control, see below.
p_exposed: 0.001

# Probability per exposed cell and time step to transition to infected state
# The default corresponds to a mean incubation period of 5 time steps
p_infected: 0.2

# Probability to recover if infected
# Note that p_recovered + p_deceased need to be smaller than 1
# The default is set to 1/14=0.0714, modeling that, on average, infection
# require approximately 14 days to go away.
p_recovered: 0.0714

# Probability to decease if the cell is infected
# Note that p_recovered + p_deceased need to be smaller than 1
# The default is set to 2%, approximating the infection fatality rate
# (see e.g. https://ourworldindata.org/mortality-risk-covid for a rough
# explanation).
p_deceased: 0.02

# Probability per site and time step to transition to empty
# As default, there are no living cells vanishing by chance i.e. the system
# is approximated to be closed for the given time scales.
p_empty: 0.

# The probability to loose immunity if a cell is recovered
# This value is quite uncertain because it is not known whether and with what
# probability immunity is lost in the case of Covid-19. Currently, the effect
# of losing immunity through virus mutation seem to be smaller then for the
# common influenca virus with roughly one year. However, there are studies
# suggesting that especially for light Covid-19 infections, new infections
# can happen with a probably non-negligable rate.
# The given default tries to roughly incorporate and estimate both effects.
p_lose_immunity: 0.01

# ... Movement ...............................................................
# Whether to allow cells to move away from infected neighboring cells
# If a neighbor is infected a cell searches for a random empty neighboring
# place and moves towards it. If there is no space do nothing.
move_away_from_infected: false

# Probability to move in a random direction
p_move_randomly: 0.2


# --- Exposure Control -------------------------------------------------------
# Exposure control to investigate the time-dependent influence of the
# disease driving force. Note that exposure control is applied at the
# beginning of an iteration step. It's effect is seen in the following
# time step
exposure_control:
  enabled: false

  # The number of additional exposures to be placed on the grid
  num_additional_exposures: 10

  # Add the additional exposures at the given times
  # Note that the !listgen tag creates a list from the parameters
  # (start, stop, step_size)
  # To disable, pass an empty sequence.
  at_times: !listgen [0, 100, 20]

  # Change the probability of a random exposure.
  # The expected value is a list of [iteration_step, new_value] pairs, e.g.
  #   - [10, .5]
  #   - [42, 0.]
  # ... will set p_expose from the default value to .5 at time 10 and set it
  # back to 0. at time 42.
  # To disable, pass an empty sequence.
  change_p_exposed: []


# --- Immunity Control --------------------------------------------------------
# Immunity control to investigate the time-dependent influence of actively
# provided immunities. Note that immunity control is applied at the
# beginning of an iteration step but after the exposure control. It's effect
# is seen in the following time step
immunity_control:
  enabled: false

  # The number of additional immunities to be placed on the grid
  num_additional_immunities: 10

  # Add the additional immunities at the given times
  # Note that the !listgen tag creates a list from the parameters
  # (start, stop, step_size)
  # To disable, pass an empty sequence.
  at_times: !listgen [0, 100, 20]

  # Change the probability of a random immunity when new susceptible cells
  # appear through p_susceptible.
  # The expected value is a list of [iteration_step, new_value] pairs, e.g.
  #   - [10, .5]
  #   - [42, 0.]
  # ... will set p_immune from the default value to .5 at time 10 and set it
  # back to 0. at time 42.
  # To disable, pass an empty sequence.
  change_p_immune: []


# --- Transmission Control ----------------------------------------------------
# Transmission control to investigate the time-dependent influence of actively
# changing decease transmition probabilities. Note that transmission control is
# applied at the beginning of an iteration step after the exposure and immunity
# control. It's effect is seen in the following time step
transmission_control:
  enabled: false
  # Change the probability to transmit a decease of a number of randomly
  # selected exposed or infected cells.
  # The expected value is a list of mappings
  # change_p_transmit:
  #   - time: 10
  #     num_cells: 6
  #     cell_kind: susceptible
  #     p_transmit: 0.5
  #   - time: 42
  #     num_cells: 2
  #     cell_kind: exposed
  #     p_transmit: 0.
  # ... will set p_transmit from the default value to .5 for 6 randomly
  # selected susceptible cells at time 10 and set it to 0. for 2 randomly
  # selected exposed cells at time 42.
  # If num_cells exceeds the current number of present cells with the specified
  # kind all of them are chosen to reset their p_transmit value.
  # To disable, pass an empty sequence.
  change_p_transmit: []


# --- Heterogeneities ---------------------------------------------------------
# Some cells can be permanently infected or turned into inert cells.
# Both these features are using the `select_entities` interface; consult the
# documentation regarding information on available selection modes.

# Make some cells inert: these do not take part in any of the processes
inert_cells:
  enabled: false
  mode: clustered_simple

  # Clustering parameters
  p_seed: .02                # Probability with which a cell is a cluster seed
  p_attach: .1               # Attachment probability (per neighbor)
  num_passes: 5              # How many attachment procedures to perform

# Set some cells to be permanently infected (invoked after inert cells are set)
infection_source:
  enabled: false
  mode: boundary

  # Boundary selection parameters (requires space to be set to NON-periodic!)
  boundary: bottom



# --- Output Configuration ----------------------------------------------------
# Whether to write out spatially resolved data from the CA
# If false, will write only the non-spatial `densities` and `counts` datasets.
# Setting this to false can be useful if no spatial analysis is required or if
# using very large grids.
write_ca_data: true

# HDF5 Compression level for all datasets
# A value of 1-3 is a good default. Choose a lower value if speed is limited by
# the CPU or a higher value if speed is limited by data writing.
compression: 3
