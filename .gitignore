# Ignore files and directories that are created by the content of this repo,
# e.g. when a test is carried out or an installation occurs.
#
# NOTE While this whitelisting .gitignore attempts to only let git consider
#      files explicitly, you should still take care to not commit stray files.
#      Please use a _global_ .gitignore for everything that is created by the
#      setup on _your_ machine, e.g. directories created by your code editor.
#      Do NOT add them here!
#
# See the following link on how to create a global .gitignore file:
#   https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/#create-a-global-gitignore

# By default, ignore all files, but whitelist directories
